  <p class="artist-name">Deana Lawson<br />
    American, born 1979</p>

  <p class="artist-intro">Working closely with her subjects on setting, lighting, and pose, photographer Deana Lawson
    creates intimate depictions of Black bodies interacting in both public and private spaces. The resulting images
    are formally rigorous in terms of composition every detail is meticulous and motivated as well as suggestive of
    Lawson's personal connection with those she photographs. In Roxie and Raquel, New Orleans, Louisiana, two women
    twin sisters neel in the center of a wide bed, facing away from each other, their backs touching. Each raises
    one arm above her head, gently touching her sister's hand, in a choreographed posture evocative of a stylized
    sculpture or a ritualistic, dancelike gesture. Both look toward the camera, but their expressions are not
    identical, and indeed the entire image is a study in similarity and difference.<br /><br />
    Lawson often approaches strangers who catch her eye in stores or on the street and then establishes
    relationships with them, cultivating the mutual trust that is crucial for her art. She has said, "Many subjects
    have expressed that because I am a woman they have felt comfortable posing for my camera. I am always honored
    and appreciative to be let in. I understand that it is a privilege." She draws on several traditions of
    photography, from vernacular snapshots to staged studio portraiture to the work of other Black women artists
    such as Carrie Mae Weems. Although she began her career focusing on telling African American stories through
    photographs, since 2013 she has expanded her interest in Black lives globally and has traveled to countries such
    as Ethiopia, Haiti, and Jamaica. Regardless of where her photographs are taken, saturated color continues to be
    a signature feature of Lawson's practice, and in Roxie and Raquel the multiple yellows, whites, and blacks in
    the scene come together in a complex and compelling picture of family dynamics.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
